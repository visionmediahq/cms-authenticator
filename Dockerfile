# Refer to the official Node.js image's documentation:
# https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/main/docs/BestPractices.md#smaller-images-without-npmyarn
#
# The above approach is being used to build an image without npm and the
# /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/ path which can include vulnerable packages,
# at least until the upstream image is updated. Omitting this path will result in fewer packages
# being installed and ideally fewer vulnerabilities reports.
